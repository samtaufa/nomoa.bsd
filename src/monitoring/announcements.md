## Public Announcement Resources for Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities are generally made public through different announcement
systems such as security web mails, source code updates. As such there are
a range of service providers that need to be monitored to cover the
broad range of tools deployed. Below are a list of must monitor tools.

<ul>
    <li>OpenBSD Mailing Lists (misc, tech, cvs)
    <li>Vulnerability Announcements
</ul>


### OpenBSD Mailing Lists (misc, tech, cvs)

The [mailing lists](http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html 
"Read the Netiquette Guide to Community Behaviour Guidelines for better results.")
is the public forum where OpenBSD developers get together with the interested
parties (you and me.) Fortunately the number of vulnerabilities in OpenBSD are 
rare and far between, but the [mailing lists](http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html 
"Read the Netiquette Guide to Community Behaviour Guidelines for better results.")
are a source of discussions, diagnosis and learning.

Services providing summaries of source code changes include Squish.net's 
<a href="http://www.squish.net/mailman/listinfo/odc">SRC Tracker</a>, which
I use to provide a daily digest/snapshot for perusal.

### Vulnerability Announcements

Vulnerability Announcements are generally recieved through vendors, but the expanse of 
activities on security, and products deployed on Windows ecosystem makes it
more practical to keep track of vulnerabilities through various 'industry' watch 
groups / organisations.

The following feeds are a good start for monitoring various vulnerability announcements
across a range of Operating Systems and Applications.
