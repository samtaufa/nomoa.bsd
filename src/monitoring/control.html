# Archive / Monitoring Box Configurations
---------------

To have smokeping start at boot time, you have to adapt
/etc/smokeping/config and insert the following into /etc/rc.local.

<pre class="command-line">
if [ X"smokeping" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/bin/smokeping ]; then
        install -d -o _smokeping /var/run/smokeping
        echo -n ' smokeping';   /usr/local/bin/smokeping
fi
</pre>

--- nagios-3.0.3-chroot -------------------

Sample configuration files and web server configuration can be found in
/usr/local/share/examples/nagios.


Beware that Nagios might or might not work correctly on 64bit machines.

To start nagios automatically, add these lines to /etc/rc.local

<pre class="command-line">
if [ X"nagios" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/sbin/nagios ]; then
        install -d -o _nagios /var/run/nagios
        echo -n ' nagios'; /usr/local/sbin/nagios -d /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg
fi
</pre>

--- nagios-plugins-1.4.11 -------------------

The check_dhcp and check_icmp plugins need to run with superuser
privileges. For security reasons they are not installed suid root
by default. If you want to use them, you have to either change
their mode manually or use systrace's privilege elevation feature.

For further details see /usr/local/share/doc/nagios-plugins/README.OpenBSD.

--- smstools-3.0.9p1 -------------------

To have smsd start at boot time, you have to adapt
/etc/smsd.conf and insert the following into /etc/rc.local.

<pre class="command-line">
if [ X"smsd" != X"NO" -a -x /usr/local/bin/smsd ]; then
        install -d -o _smsd /var/run/smsd
        echo -n ' smsd';        /usr/local/bin/smsd
fi
</pre>

smsd needs access to the serial port; this can be done by adding
the _smsd user to 'dialer' in /etc/group.

--- net-snmp-5.4.1.1p1 -------------------

To have snmpd start at boot time, you must edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
and add the following lines to /etc/rc.local:

<pre class="command-line">
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/snmpd ]; then
        echo -n ' snmpd';       /usr/local/sbin/snmpd
fi
</pre>

This will start snmpd and use /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf for the configuration. 
The snmpconf tool can be used to help edit your configuration files.  See 
snmpconf(1), snmpd(8), and snmpd.conf(5) for more options.
