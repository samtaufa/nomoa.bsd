$!OpenBSD!$ 
is a __fun platform__ to immerse in networking principals, software, 
security, and Operating Systems (if you're delusional, into 
gratification through pain and deprivation ;) It is well documented 
through Unix $!manpage("man")!$(ual) pages, with a lucid online 
[Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/)(FAQ)

show you how to setup a secure server, and they just might give 
you suggestions that will make your setup insecure.

### Build and Consistency

Putting together an OpenBSD box is fun and easy, although
there are a few hurdles that can seem daunting for the new
user, the process is well defined and documented. Take a look
here for a few areas that might be interesting to review
before a system install (especially for new users.)

Likewise, we try to put here general issues to consider when
planning to roll-out OpenBSD to your critical infrastructure.

### Secured Communications

Your first step in connecting your new OpenBSD box, to anything, is
to read the [OpenBSD FAQ 6 - Networking](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html)
document. And then, read it again.

Afterwards,  we explore some useful notes for sharing and 
securing communications services.

#### Mail Server

E-mail may just be the lifeblood of the Internet, 
unless you're younger than 25. 
Various tools come together to provide what is generally termed an E-mail Server, 
and we bring together some of these key tools on $!OpenBSD!$.

-   an SMTP Server, using [Sendmail](comms/mail.html) or
    [Postfix](comms/mail/postfix.html)
-   Client access (POP3, IMAP, TLS server) using [Dovecot](
    comms/mail/dovecot.html)

### Gateways and Perimeter Systems

$!OpenBSD!$ is a great tool for securing your borders and gateways
and comes pre-configured with tools for 
[High Availability](borders/highavailability.html)
through redundancy and Load Balancing.

### Monitoring 

Monitoring involves passive accumulation of events, and the
decision process from these. We review process and tools for
monitoring for the security of our configurations.

### Configuration Maintenance

When you need to patch or quickly rebuild machines in production, then 
a sane methodology for securing distributed configurations
is mandatory.



##  Off Topic

These notes are an evolution of offline notes required to initiate
an underfunded school network/internet connectivity. Few schools 
have the funds to spend on quality staff, let alone quality hardware
or software. With this problem in mind, and a desire to experiment 
with new software, old hardware, we embarked on downloading, installing, 
reformatting and reinstalling a bunch of tools from the Internet 
in the hope to providing students with an exciting learning environment 
while at the same time limiting the cost blow-outs from buying new 
hardware and unnecessary software licenses.

Initially with limited Internet connectivity we struggled for information/documentation 
on how to participate in this information revolution. These notes 
will go a long way to helping find the reference resources on the 
'NET, and hopefully answer many of the general questions for installing 
and maintaining services. 

It's between lean times between working with $!OpenBSD!$ servers, and
now that I'm back managing hosts we hope to keep these notes more up
to date.
