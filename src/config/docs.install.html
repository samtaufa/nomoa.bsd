SETUP :

- Each remote host must have the user account "${SYNCBACK_USER}" created, which has
  a valid shell, and the public part of an SSH key which the central backup
  host uses to connect and pull the latest backup tar file.

  Remote hosts should then be configured to create a tar file once a day,
  which includes all the paths and files that should be backed up on a
  regular basis.

- The central host should have a user which the backup system is run as
  (${SYNCBACK_USER} is fine here as well).  This user needs to have the private
  part of the SSH key for which the public part is used on the remote
  hosts.

  The central host should be configured to run once day, N hours after the
  remote hosts are configured to create their tar files - where N is a
  figure that ensures any successful tar has been completed.

  The central host also needs to have a canonical baseline tar file for
  each host to be sync'd.  These baselines represent the "accepted" state
  of a machine, and each nightly sync is tested against it's baseline to
  identify the following things (raised as warnings if found),

    - If any of the files in the sync'd archive have changed, if so how

    - If any new files have been introduced into the sync'd archive

- Any warnings are emailed back to the administrator, who can then either
  revert the changes on the remote host, or accept the changes into the
  accepted repository.  If a warning is raised, the sync'd tarfile is
  retained.

- The filesystem structure needed is as follows,

    - Remote Host
    
    /var/syncback => Contains latest backup tar file
    
    Permissions for the directory is 770 for root:${SYNCBACK_USER}

    - Central Host
    
    /var/syncback/approved => Contains the canonical approved trees of
    files for each host

    /var/syncback/sync => The path to which the syncs are pulled

    /var/syncback/tmp => The path to which the syncs are unpacked for
    comparison with the approved tree
    
    /var/syncback.local => Contains latest backup tar file for localhost

    Permissions for the directory are 770 for root:${SYNCBACK_USER}
