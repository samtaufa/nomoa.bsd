# Network monitoring with Nagios and OpenBSD

&#91;Ref: OpenBSD 5.0, Nagios 3.3.1, [Nagios Core 3.x Manuals](http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nagioscore/3/en/toc.html)]

After you've hounded the web for how to install and configure Nagios for
your system, check-out the definitive [Project Documentation](http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/) 
Note that the web often spews incorrect, misleading, misinformed datapoints.

These evolving guides are around OpenBSD 5.0 and Nagios 3.3.1.

If you are relatively new to Nagios, then I suggest that our install be in
the following steps:

- 	[Install](nagios/install.html) the binaries
-	Use the [Console](nagios/console.html) to test connectivity to nodes you
	intend to monitor.
-	[Config](nagios/config.html)ure your monitoring service.

Although the [Install](nagios/install.html)/[Config](nagios/config.html)uration
process is relatively simple, a new person to monitoring will get a lot of insight into
how/what Nagios does for you by studying the [Console](nagios/console.html)/command-line
tools and the [Logs](nagios/install.html#log)

The flexibility of Nagios is it's huge cost. But once you get the time, and can get
through the learning curve, you will have an amazing tool.
