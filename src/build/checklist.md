## The Checklist Manifesto

simply state's that we're:

- human,
- the expanse of knowledge required to consistently
complete your job has gone beyond the individuals
cognitive ability to retain all knowledge in their head

Checklists should be developed to improve your ability
to communicate and achieve your goals for performance
and quality.
