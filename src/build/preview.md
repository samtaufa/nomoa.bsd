## Before you Install

### 1st Timer

For the 1st Time investigation into installing OpenBSD, you
may be more interested in the general things a new user
might come across, such as those previewed in [First
Time Installer](preview/first.html) and related topics always relevant when
you don't have the equipment, but wish to make some initial
installation investigations:

-   [First Time Installer](preview/first.html)
-   [Dual Booting](preview/multiboot.html)
-   [Start Up](preview/rc.conf.html) - 
    specifying what starts with the machine


The thing to remember, is to enjoy the new experience, and
where possible, __dig__ in and learn some more about the
environment (whether it is the base Operating System, a specific
tool you're using, or the hardware.)

### Build Consistency

Build consistency assumes a decent level of experience with 
the operating system and services being installed. In this 
section of the notes are some basic installation
issues surrounding a new OpenBSD install.
