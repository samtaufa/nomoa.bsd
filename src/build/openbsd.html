# Standardised OpenBSD Install Notes

## Introduction

We seek with these guidelines a systematic process to maximise consistency of
build quality that is documented, repeatable and based on best practises.

The host build process incorporates a number of different aspects to maximise
functionality, stability, maintainability and security. 
All important facets of the distributed hosts.

Key aspects of this process include:

<ul>
        <li>Hardware Test
        <li>Opearing System Install
        <li>Access Control (User Accounts etc.)
        <li>Apps/Services, Post Build Testing
</ul>

## Hardware Testing

<a href="openbsd/hardware_test.html">Hardware burn-in</a> 
involves hardware resource stress, burn-in testing to disqualify
hardware prior to deployment where detectable defects exist.

Existing tests include:

<ul>
    <li> Ram with memtest86 (i386) or memtest++(amd64)
    <li> HDD bonnie++ et. al.
    <li> Network Interfaces with tcpbench, tcpblast
    <li> System Wide stress from ports/sysutils
</ul>

## OS Install, Build Testing

During the process of <a href="openbsd/osinstall.html">installing the Operating System</a>, 
improve security configuring best-practice systematic lock-down and verification.

Basic configurations include:

<ul>
    <li>Base OS Install
    <li>User Creation, Management
    <li>Log Rotation Policy
    <li>Publicly available resources (e.g. inetd)
    <li>Local email delivery
    <li>OpenSSH
    <li>sudoers
</ul>

## Apps/Services, Post Build Testing

<a href="openbsd/apptest.html">Application and Service Tests</a> are not
readily packaged into software toolkits. Where available, repeatable tests
to validate an applications expected behaviour prior to deployment.

Validation tests can be significant and may evolve into their own documentation
tree including build instructions for the software system, together with 
validation tests.
