## Serving with Postfix

&#91;Ref: [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org)]

<blockquote>
Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has a definite 
Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different. 
</blockquote>

OpenBSD ships preconfigured with [Sendmail](http://www.sendmail.org) as 
the mail server (MTA.) 

For various reasons, we have investigated, installed, maintained diverse
configurations of Postfix as a Mail Server (MTA.) This section of notes 
explore configurations for Postfix we have deployed.

-	[GUI Admin](postfix/admin.html)istration using PostfixAdmin for User Administration
	of Mail Accounts maintained through SQL Databases
-	[Mail Server](postfix/server.html) Postfix as a replacement for sendmail
-	[MX Proxy](postfix/proxy.html) Postfix as a passthrough Proxy between
	your Internal Mail Servers and the bad Internet.
-	[MX Proxy Multiple Instances](postfix/instances.html) Postfix as an MX Proxy, but
	with some low-cost, high-value filtering enabled.
-	[Virtual Accounts](postfix/virtual_accounts.html) A basic Postfix configuration
	for email virtual accounts.
-	[Multiple Virtual Domains](postfix/virtual_domains.html) An extended
	example of the above, with virtual accounts for more than a single domain.
