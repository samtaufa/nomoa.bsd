## Web Interface

A popular means of provisioning e-mail to clients, is
through the use of a Web Front-End to mail services. For these, 
there are a plethora of Open Souce tools, available in the OpenBSD
ports collection such as:

- OpenWebMail
- RoundCube
- SquirrelMail

Each with unique advantages, limitations.
