## Web Presence and Portal

OpenBSD is a decent web presence system, with a good selection of
of pre-built Content Management Systems. From the ports collection
I have installed and successfully deployed:

- Plone <a href="http://www.plone.com">www.plone.com</a>
- Drupal

From the web I've also downloaded and used, at least the following
through OpenBSD's PHP, and MySQL ports.

- Xaraya <a href="http://www.xaraya.com">www.xaraya.com</a>
